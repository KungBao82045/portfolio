# Face Recognition

Just in case you have missing modules. I recommend to run this on VSCode.

(1) Install modules:

  - pip3 install numpy
  - pip3 install face_recognition
  - pip3 install opencv-python

(2) If you want to install modules locally, do this:

  1. python3 -m venv venv
  2. source venv/bin/activate
  3. Do the pip install in (1)

OBS: Make sure to run face recognition python files exactly in the folder. Otherwise, it will not work.
