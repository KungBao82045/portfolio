Get the ***cascades/data*** folder and place it in ***portfolio/Python Projects/facial_recognition/***
https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/OpenCV-Python-Series/tree/master/src/cascades/data


If you dont, facial recognition will not work üòê

OBS: Make sure to run face recognition python files exactly in the folder you are in. Dont run the python file from folder to folder. Otherwise, it will not work.
