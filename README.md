# Face Recognition

Just in case you have some missing modules.

(1) Install modules:

  - pip3 install numpy
  - pip3 install face_recognition
  - pip3 install opencv-python

(2) If you want to install modules locally, do this:

  1. python3 -m venv venv
  2. source venv/bin/activate
  3. Do the pip install in (1)

OBS: Make sure to run face recognition python files exactly in the folder you are in. Dont run the python file from folder to folder. Otherwise, it will not work.

Get the Cascades from GitHub and place the folder in ***portfolio/Python Projects/facial_recognition/***
