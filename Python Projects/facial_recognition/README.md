***How does my face recognition work?***

This is Python code I made: ***face_reco_webcam.py*** that detects and recognise faces from "faces/" folder. If your face is not inside the "faces/" folder, you will be displayed as "Unknown" under the green recognizer box of the screen. To use this script, create "faces" directory in the same folder as ***face_reco_webcam.py*** and add faces there. The face image should format like this: your_name_example.png

In addition, I added comments that explain that they do.

OBS: Make sure to run face_reco_webcam.py in face_recognition folder. Otherwise, it will not work.

OPTIONAL: If you want to capture your face from ***faceCapture.py*** and save it to the "faces" folder, get the Cascades from GitHub and 

place 

cascades/data/ folder

in 

portfolio/Python Projects/facial_recognition/
