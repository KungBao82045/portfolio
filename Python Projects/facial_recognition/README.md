***How does my face recognition worked***

This is Python code I made: ***face_reco_webcam.py***
It is made to analyze and recognize faces to people if their face image is in the "faces/" foldier. If your face is not inside the "faces/" folder, you will be displayed as "Unknown" under the grenn recognizer box of the screen.

In order to display your name, your face image must be named like this: "your_name_example.png".


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBS: Make sure to run face recognition python files exactly in the folder you are in. Dont run the python file from folder to folder. Otherwise, it will not work.
OBS: If you want to use ***faceCapture.py***, you will need to get the Cascades from GitHub and place the ***cascades/data/*** folder in ***portfolio/Python Projects/facial_recognition/*** https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/OpenCV-Python-Series/tree/master/src/cascades/data
This will allow you to capture your face and saved inside the "faces/" folder.
